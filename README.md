# Crowdfunding-ETL
## Overview
The client has provided us with a large amount of data in separate csv files. They would like us to create a database to easily generate reports for stakeholders.
## Purpose
Help the client organize their csv files to provide easy to extract reports.
## Results & Analysis
After investigating the csv files, files were cleaned and loaded onto Postgres. Reports extracted include an email distribution list to advise key contacts their remaining funding goal and a distribution list for backers.
